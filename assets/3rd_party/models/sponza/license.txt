July 14, 2011 Morgan McGuire modified the model from Crytek's OBJ
export to correct some small errors.  He computed bump maps from the
normal maps using normal2bump.cpp (http://cs.williams.edu/~morgan/code/), 
put the "mask" textures into the alpha channel of the associated diffuse 
texture, cleaned up noise in the masks, created the missing gi_flag.tga 
texture, and removed the long untextured banner floating in the middle 
of the atrium that appears in the file but in none of the published images 
of the model.  The banner is in banner.obj.

Sponza Model
August 19, 2010
The Atrium Sponza Palace, Dubrovnik, is an elegant and improved model created 
by Frank Meinl. The original Sponza model was created by Marko Dabrovic in 
early 2002. Over the years, the Sponza Atrium scene has become one of the 
most popular 3D scenes for testing global illumination and radiosity due to 
it's specific architectural structure which is particularly complex for global 
illumination light.

However, nowadays it is considered as a simple model, thus it was decided to 
crate a new model with highly improved appearance and scene complexity. It is 
donated to the public for  radiosity and is represented in several different 
formats (3ds, Obj) for use with various commercial 3D applications and renderers.

Modifications to Sponza Model by Frank Meinl by Johannes Unterguggenberger, 
February 2018:

Split sponza.obj into three different model files, each containing parts of 
the original model file:
sponza_structure.obj
sponza_plants.obj
sponza_fabric.obj

Modified one of the doors to lead out of the building: Removed the door and
added a passage which leads all the way through the outside walls.
This modification is contained in sponza_structure.obj.

Created normal maps for several materials. 
These are also referenced from the materials file.
